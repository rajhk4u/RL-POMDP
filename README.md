# Reinforcement Learning for POMDP: Rollout and Policy Iteration
– Application to Autonomous Sequential Repair Problem- An agent has to traverse along a pipeline to repair damages.
– Implemented algorithms for the simulator, belief state estimator, base policy estimation, Rollout algorithm, and
Approximate Policy Iteration with Neural Network classifier.
